# Azure secret management plugin

<Highlight title="Default mount path">

  The default mount path for the `azure` secrets plugin is `/auth/azure`.

</Highlight>

The `azure` secrets plugin provides a simple, flexible way to manage permissions
for service principals.

Use the plugin to generate Azure service principals along with the relevant roles
and group assignments. Then map Vault roles to one or more of the generated
Azure roles and the associated group assignments. 

Associating each of the generated service principals with a Vault lease means that
when the Vault lease expires, the service principal is automatically deleted.

If you specify a pre-existing service principal as part of the role
configuration, Vault automatically creates a new password instead of a new
service principal and then deletes the password when the lease expires.
