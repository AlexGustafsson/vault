# Azure authentication plugin

<Highlight title="Default mount path">

  The default mount path for the `azure` authentication plugin is `/auth/azure`.

</Highlight>

The `azure` authentication plugin lets Vault work with Azure as a trusted third
party. Clients can authenticate to Vault with a JSON web token (JWT) signed by
Azure Active Directory for the configured tenant.

The `azure` plugin supports authentication with system-assigned and
user-assigned [managed identities] in Azure.
