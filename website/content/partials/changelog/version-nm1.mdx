### Features

- **AWS Static Roles**: The AWS Secrets Engine can manage static roles configured by users. [[GH-20536](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/20536)]
- **Automated License Utilization Reporting**: Added automated license
  utilization reporting, which sends minimal product-license [metering
  data](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting)
  to HashiCorp without requiring you to manually collect and report them.
- **Environment Variables through Vault Agent**: Introducing a new process-supervisor mode for Vault Agent which allows injecting secrets as environment variables into a child process using a new `env_template` configuration stanza. The process-supervisor configuration can be generated with a new `vault agent generate-config` helper tool. [[GH-20530](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/20530)]
- **MongoDB Atlas Database Secrets**: Adds support for client certificate credentials [[GH-20425](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/20425)]
- **MongoDB Atlas Database Secrets**: Adds support for generating X.509 certificates on dynamic roles for user authentication [[GH-20882](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/20882)]
- **NEW PKI Workflow in UI**: Completes generally available rollout of new PKI UI that provides smoother mount configuration and a more guided user experience [[GH-pki-ui-improvements](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/pki-ui-improvements)]
- **Secrets/Auth Plugin Multiplexing**: The plugin will be multiplexed when run
  as an external plugin by vault versions that support secrets/auth plugin
  multiplexing (> 1.12) [[GH-19215](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/19215)]
- **Sidebar Navigation in UI**: A new sidebar navigation panel has been added in the UI to replace the top navigation bar. [[GH-19296](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/19296)]
- **Vault PKI ACME Server**: Support for the ACME certificate lifecycle management protocol has been added to the Vault PKI Plugin. This allows standard ACME clients, such as the EFF's certbot and the CNCF's k8s cert-manager, to request certificates from a Vault server with no knowledge of Vault APIs or authentication mechanisms. For public-facing Vault instances, we recommend requiring External Account Bindings (EAB) to limit the ability to request certificates to only authenticated clients. [[GH-20752](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/20752)]
- **Vault Proxy**: Introduced Vault Proxy, a new subcommand of the Vault binary that can be invoked using `vault proxy -config=config.hcl`. It currently has the same feature set as Vault Agent's API proxy, but the two may diverge in the future. We plan to deprecate the API proxy functionality of Vault Agent in a future release. [[GH-20548](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/20548)]
- **OCI Auto-Auth**: Add OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) auto-auth method [[GH-19260](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/19260)]
