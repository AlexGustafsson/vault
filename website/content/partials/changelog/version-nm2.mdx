## 1.13.1 — March 29, 2023 ((#1.13.1))

### Security

- storage/mssql: When using Vault’s community-supported Microsoft SQL (MSSQL) database storage backend, a privileged attacker with the ability to write arbitrary data to Vault’s configuration may be able to perform arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database server through Vault. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-0620, is fixed in Vault 1.13.1, 1.12.5, and 1.11.9. [[HCSEC-2023-12](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2023-12-vault-s-microsoft-sql-database-storage-backend-vulnerable-to-sql-injection-via-configuration-file/52080)]
- secrets/pki: Vault’s PKI mount issuer endpoints did not correctly authorize access to remove an issuer or modify issuer metadata, potentially resulting in denial of service of the PKI mount. This bug did not affect public or private key material, trust chains or certificate issuance. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-0665, is fixed in Vault 1.13.1, 1.12.5, and 1.11.9. [[HCSEC-2023-11](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2023-11-vault-s-pki-issuer-endpoint-did-not-correctly-authorize-access-to-issuer-metadata/52079)]
- core: HashiCorp Vault’s implementation of Shamir’s secret sharing used precomputed table lookups, and was vulnerable to cache-timing attacks. An attacker with access to, and the ability to observe a large number of unseal operations on the host through a side channel may reduce the search space of a brute force effort to recover the Shamir shares. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-25000, is fixed in Vault 1.13.1, 1.12.5, and 1.11.9. [[HCSEC-2023-10](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2023-10-vault-vulnerable-to-cache-timing-attacks-during-seal-and-unseal-operations/52078)]

- auth/approle: When using the Vault and Vault Enterprise (Vault) approle auth method, any authenticated user with access to the /auth/approle/role/:role_name/secret-id-accessor/destroy endpoint can destroy the secret ID of any other role by providing the secret ID accessor. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-24999 has been fixed in Vault 1.13.0, 1.12.4, 1.11.8, 1.10.11 and above. [[HSEC-2023-07](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2023-07-vault-fails-to-verify-if-approle-secretid-belongs-to-role-during-a-destroy-operation/51305)]

  This will only be used internally for implementing user lockout. [[GH-17104](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/17104)]
- core: Bump Go version to 1.20.1.
- core: Vault version has been moved out of sdk and into main vault module.

- logging: Removed legacy environment variable for log format ('LOGXI_FORMAT'), should use 'VAULT_LOG_FORMAT' instead [[GH-17822](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/17822)]
- plugins: Mounts can no longer be pinned to a specific _builtin_ version. Mounts previously pinned to a specific builtin version will now automatically upgrade to the latest builtin version, and may now be overridden if an unversioned plugin of the same name and type is registered. Mounts using plugin versions without `builtin` in their metadata remain unaffected. [[GH-18051](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/18051)]

- plugins: `GET` for `/sys/auth`, `/sys/auth/:path`, `/sys/mounts`, and `/sys/mounts/:path` paths now return additional `plugin_version`, `running_plugin_version` and `running_sha256` fields in the response data for each mount. [[GH-17167](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/17167)]
- sdk: Remove version package, make useragent.String versionless. [[GH-19068](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/19068)]
- secrets/aws: do not create leases for non-renewable/non-revocable STS credentials to reduce storage calls [[GH-15869](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/15869)]

[[GH-19194](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/19194)]
- **GCP Secrets Impersonated Account Support**: Add support for GCP service account impersonation, allowing callers to generate a GCP access token without requiring Vault to store or retrieve a GCP service account key for each role. [[GH-19018](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/19018)]

- **VMSS Flex Authentication**: Adds support for Virtual Machine Scale Set Flex Authentication [[GH-19077](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/19077)]
- **Namespaces (enterprise)**: Added the ability to allow access to secrets and more to be shared across namespaces that do not share a namespace hierarchy. Using the new `sys/config/group-policy-application` API, policies can be configured to apply outside of namespace hierarchy, allowing this kind of cross-namespace sharing.
- **OpenAPI-based Go & .NET Client Libraries (Beta)**: We have now made available two new [[OpenAPI-based Go](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-client-go/)] & [[OpenAPI-based .NET](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-client-dotnet/)] Client libraries (beta). You can use them to perform various secret management operations easily from your applications.
