### Sublogger levels not adjusted on reload

In Vault versions predating 1.13.7, 1.14.3, and 1.15.0 Vault does not honor a
modified `log_level` configuration for certain subsystem loggers on SIGHUP.

This is known to affect the `resolver.watcher` and `replication.index.*`
subloggers.

This can be seen after modifying the `log_level` and issuing a reload (SIGHUP),
For example, after starting a server with `log_level: "debug"` and modifying it
to `log_level: "info"` the following lines appear after reload:

```
[TRACE] resolver.watcher: dr mode doesn't have failover support, returning
...
[DEBUG] replication.index.perf: saved checkpoint: num_dirty=5
[DEBUG] replication.index.local: saved checkpoint: num_dirty=0
[DEBUG] replication.index.periodic: starting WAL GC: from=2531280 to=2531280 last=2531536
```

The workaround is to restart the Vault server.
