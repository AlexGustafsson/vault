If a user provides bad credentials several times in quick succession, 
Vault will stop trying to validate their credentials for a while, instead returning immediately 
with a permission denied error. We call this behavior "user lockout". The time for which 
an user will be locked out is called “lockout duration”. The user will be able to login after the lockout 
duration has passed. The number of failed login attempts after which the user is locked out is called 
“lockout threshold”. The lockout threshold counter is reset to zero after a few minutes without login attempts, 
or upon a successful login attempt. The duration after which the counter will be reset to zero
after no login attempts is called "lockout counter reset". This can defeat both automated and targeted requests 
i.e, user-based password guessing attacks as well as automated attacks. 

The user lockout feature is enabled by default. The default values for "lockout threshold" is 5 attempts, 
"lockout duration" is 15 minutes, "lockout counter reset" is 15 minutes.

The user lockout feature can disabled globally using the environment variable VAULT_DISABLE_USER_LOCKOUT or in the 
configuration file for "all" auth methods or a specific auth method using "disable_lockout" parmater within user_lockout stanza
or for a particular auth mount using "auth tune". 

~> **NOTE**: This feature is available from  Vault version 1.13 and is only supported by userpass, ldap and approle auth methods.
