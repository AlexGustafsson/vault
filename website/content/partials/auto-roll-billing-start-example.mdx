For example, Assume a customer has signed a deal for 3 years with a license start date of Dec 1 2023. After upgrading to the version with this change, the billing start date 
auto-rolls to the most recent year.
- If the upgrade happens on Sept 1 2024, the billing start date will continue to be Dec 1 2023. When we are on Dec 1 2024, the billing start date 
will automatically roll to Dec 1, 2024. 
- If the upgrade happens on Dec 15 2024, the billing start date should automatically roll to Dec 1, 2024 after upgrade.
