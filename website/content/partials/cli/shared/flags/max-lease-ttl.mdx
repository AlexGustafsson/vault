**`-max-lease-ttl (string : "")`**

Maximum time-to-live allowed in `<number>[s|m|h|d]` format for the associated
lease.

When left unset, Vault uses the value of the global configuration setting
`max_lease_ttl` as the default. If the global configuration setting is also
unset, the default is "768h".

**Example**: `-max-lease-ttl "5m"`
