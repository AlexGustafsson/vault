## Managed keys

~> Note: Managed keys are an Enterprise only feature.

The [Generate Root](#generate-root) and [Generate Intermediate](#generate-intermediate)
API calls can leverage the Managed Keys feature, delegating operations that
require private key material to an external system.

To leverage a Managed Key, assuming it has already been configured, set the type
parameter to `kms` within either, [Generate Root](#generate-root) or
[Generate Intermediate](#generate-intermediate) APIs, and one of either
`managed_key_name` or `managed_key_id` parameters specifying a Managed Key to use.
As with the `internal` type for those APIs, if the type parameter is set to `kms`,
there is no way to read/fetch the private key.

The API call will fail if the specified Managed Key is not properly configured or
arguments detailing private key attributes are specified such as `key_type` or
`key_bits`.

Once either of the certificate APIs have successfully executed, all other PKI
operations behave the same, with no other special configuration or parameters required.
