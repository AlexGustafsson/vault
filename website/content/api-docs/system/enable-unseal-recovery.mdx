# `/sys/enable-unseal-recovery`

The `/sys/enable-unseal-recovery` endpoint is used to enable the unsealing of
Vault via recovery keys for clusters that were initialized prior to version 1.13
or which were initialized with `disable_unseal_recovery` true.
This feature can only be used if using an automatic unseal mechanism with recovery
keys.  Once successful, auto-seals can be placed in 
[unseal recovery mode](/vault/docs/concepts/seal#unseal-recovery-mode).
