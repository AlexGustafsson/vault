# PKI secrets engine (API) - Managing keys and issuers

@include 'x509-sha1-deprecation.mdx'

This is the API documentation for the Vault PKI secrets engine. For general
information about the usage and operation of the PKI secrets engine, please see
the [PKI documentation](/vault/docs/secrets/pki).

This documentation assumes the PKI secrets engine is enabled at the `/pki` path
in Vault. Since it is possible to enable secrets engines at any location, please
update your API calls accordingly.
