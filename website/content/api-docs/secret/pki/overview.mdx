# PKI secrets engine (API) - Overview

@include 'x509-sha1-deprecation.mdx'

This is the API documentation for the Vault PKI secrets engine. For general
information about the usage and operation of the PKI secrets engine, please see
the [PKI documentation](/vault/docs/secrets/pki).

This documentation assumes the PKI secrets engine is enabled at the `/pki` path
in Vault. Since it is possible to enable secrets engines at any location, please
update your API calls accordingly.

## Notice about new Multi-Issuer functionality

Vault since 1.11.0 allows a single PKI mount to have multiple Certificate
Authority (CA) certificates ("issuers") in a single mount, for the purpose
of facilitating rotation. All issuers within a single mount are treated as a
single Authority, meaning that:

 1. Certificate Revocation List (CRL) configuration is common to all issuers,
 2. All authority access URLs are common to all issuers,
 3. Issued certificates' serial numbers will be unique across all issuers.

However, since each issuer may have a distinct subject and keys, different
issuers may have different CRLs.

It is _strongly_ encouraged to limit the scope of CAs within a mount and not
to mix different types of CAs (roots and intermediates).

~> **Note**: Some functionality will not work if a default issuer is not
   configured. Vault automatically selects the default issuer from the
   current issuing certificate on migration from an older Vault version
   (Vault < 1.11.0).
