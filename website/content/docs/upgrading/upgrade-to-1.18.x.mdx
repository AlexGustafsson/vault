# Overview

The Vault 1.18.x upgrade guide contains information on deprecations, important
or breaking changes, and remediation recommendations for anyone upgrading from
Vault 1.17. **Please read carefully**.

## Important changes

### Activity Log Changes

#### Default Activity Log Querying Period

The field `default_report_months` can no longer be configured or read. Any previously set values
will be ignored by the system.


Attempts to modify `default_report_months` through the
[/sys/internal/counters/config](/vault/api-docs/system/internal-counters#update-the-client-count-configuration)
endpoint, will result in the following warning from Vault:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session

WARNING! The following warnings were returned from Vault:

  * default_report_months is deprecated: defaulting to billing start time


```

</CodeBlockConfig>


The `current_billing_period` toggle for `/sys/internal/counters/activity` is also deprecated, as this will be set
true by default.

Attempts to set `current_billing_period` will result in the following warning from Vault:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session

WARNING! The following warnings were returned from Vault:

  * current_billing_period is deprecated; unless otherwise specified, all requests will default to the current billing period


```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Auto-rolled billing start date

 As of 1.18 and later, the billing start date (license start date if not configured) rolls over to the latest billing year at the end of the last cycle i.e; billing start dates from 
 earlier years will get updated to current calendar year, unless the date has not yet occured this year, in which case
 it will remain in the last calendar year. The billing start date will adjust accordingly for leap years.
