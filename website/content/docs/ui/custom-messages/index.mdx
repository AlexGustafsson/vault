# Manage custom messages in the Vault UI

Use custom banners and modals in the Vault UI to share system-wide alerts for all Vault UI users. Users can then dismiss messages by clicking "X" on a banner or "Confirm" for a modal.

## Before you start

- **You must have Vault 1.16.0 or higher installed**.
- **You must have admin-level permission for the Vault UI**.

## Add a custom message

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section in the Vault UI sidebar and select "Custom
   Messages".

1. On the **Custom messages** page, select whether you want the message
   to appear on the Vault UI login page or after a user logs in.

1. Select the **+ Create message** button in the toolbar to open the **Create message** form.

1. On the **Create message** form:

   - Select the locations where your message should appear.
   - Select the message type.
   - Provide a title and the message text. For important messages, we recommend
     keeping the text short and including a link to more information rather
     than writing a longer message that users may not take the time to read.
   - Set a start time when your message will publish. By default, messages
     publish at midnight in your local timezone.
   - Set an optional end time for the message. By default, messages do not
     expire.

1. Click **Preview** to see how your message will appear to users.

1. Click **Create message** to save your new message.
