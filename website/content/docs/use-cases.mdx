# Use Cases

[HashiCorp Vault](/docs/what-is-vault) is an identity-based secrets and encryption management system. Vault validates and authorizes clients (users, machines, apps) before providing them access to secrets or stored sensitive data.

This page describes common Vault use cases and provides related resources that you can use to create Vault configurations and workflows. Please note that not all use cases may be listed.

#### General Secret Storage

Vault provides a secure way to store sensitive environment variables, database credentials, API keys, etc. Currently, these variables are stored in plaintext, configuration management, and databases. Vault adds a layer of protection by allowing you to query using `vault read` or the API. This approach protects the plaintext version of these secrets, and all records access with the Vault audit log.

#### Employee Credential Storage

Vault provides a secure solution for storing employee credentials. With Vault, employees may share access to web services securely.

Vault's audit logs gather and list all secret accessed by users (employees). Audit logs make it effortless to manage and roll keys to keep secrets secure.

#### API Key Generation for Scripts

The dynamic secrets feature of Vault is ideal for scripts: an AWS
access key can be generated for the duration of a script, and then revoked.
The keypair exists only while the script runs; consequently, the keys are logged only when the keypair exists.

Dynamic secrets add a layer of security beyond Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions by hard-coding limited-access access tokens in various locations.

#### Data Encryption

In addition to storing secrets, Vault can be used to
encrypt/decrypt data that is stored elsewhere, essentially allowing applications to encrypt their data while still storing it in the
primary data store. This provides a benefit to developers since the responsibility of encryption lies within the Vault's security team to manage, and thereby, allowing developers to solely focus on encrypting/decrypting data as needed.
