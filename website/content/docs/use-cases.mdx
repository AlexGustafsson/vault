# Use Cases

[HashiCorp Vault](/docs/what-is-vault) is an identity-based secrets and encryption management system. Vault validates and authorizes clients (users, machines, apps) before providing them access to secrets or stored sensitive data.

This page describes common Vault use cases and provides related resources that you can use to create Vault configurations and workflows. Please note that not all use cases may be listed.

## Secrets Management

In today's dynamic environments where applications and systems are ever-changing, a standard static IP-based solution to store, access, and distribute secrets to these applications and systems does not scale well. IP-based static solutions can introduce many challenges when organizations require complex and redundant systems to manage their secret sprawl. For example, the more complex the solution to manage secrets across applications, systems, and infrastructure, the more likelihood of an increase in threat surface. Vault's [secret management](/docs/secrets) centrally manages and enforces access to secrets and systems based on trusted sources of application and user identity. Further, secrets management also includes the ability to distribute dynamic secrets where sensitive information is protected in flight and at rest. Rather than use credentials to grant access, Vault uses tokens to ensure the least privilege with security and break glass functionality.

## Data Encryption

Many organizations seek solutions to encrypt/decrypt application data but deploying cryptography and maintaining a complex key management infrastructure can be expensive and difficult to develop against, especially within a cloud or multi-datacenter environment.  Vault provides [encryption as a service](/docs/secrets/transit) with centralized key management to simplify encrypting data in transit and at rest across clouds and datacenters. Vault can encrypt/decrypt data stored elsewhere, essentially allowing applications to encrypt their data while still storing it in the primary data store. This benefits developers since the responsibility of encryption lie within the Vault's security team to manage, allowing developers to focus solely on encrypting/decrypting data as needed.

## Identity-Based Access

Organizations need a way to manage identity sprawl with the proliferation of different clouds, services, and systems- all with their own identity providers. The risk of compromising an organization's security infrastructure increases as organizations are forced to manage multiple identity management systems as they try to implement solutions to unify a single logical identity across multiple cloud platforms. Different platforms support different methods and constructs for identity, which makes it difficult to recognize one user or identity across multiple forms of credentials. Vault solves this challenge by using a unified ACL system to broker access to systems and secrets and merge identities across providers. With [identity-based access](/docs/secrets/identity), organizations can leverage any trusted resource of identity to enforce system and application access and authenticate across different clouds, systems, and endpoints.
