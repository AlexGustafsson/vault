# Use Cases

[HashiCorp Vault](/docs/what-is-vault) is an identity-based secrets and encryption management system. Vault validates and authorizes clients (users, machines, apps) before providing them access to secrets or stored sensitive data.

This page describes common Vault use cases and provides related resources that can be used to create Vault configurations and workflows. Please note that not all use cases may be listed.

## Secrets Management

In today's dynamic environments, applications and systems are ever-changing. With changing systems, standard static IP-based solutions that store, access, and distribute secrets to applications and systems do not scale well. IP-based static solutions may also pose challenges when organizations require complex and redundant systems to manage their secret sprawl. For example, the more complex the solution to manage secrets across applications, systems, and infrastructure, the more likelihood of an increase in threat surface. Vault's [secret management](/docs/secrets) solution centrally manages and enforces access to secrets and systems based on trusted sources of application and user identity.  Rather than use credentials to grant access, Vault uses tokens to balance and manage access privilege with security and break glass functionality.

Further, secrets management also includes the ability to distribute dynamic secrets where sensitive information is protected in transit and stored.

## Data Encryption

Many organizations seek solutions to encrypt/decrypt application data within a cloud or multi-datacenter environment; deploying cryptography and maintaining a complex key management infrastructure can be expensive and challenging to develop. Vault provides [encryption as a service](/docs/secrets/transit) with centralized key management to simplify encrypting data in transit and stored across clouds and datacenters. Vault can encrypt/decrypt data stored elsewhere, essentially allowing applications to encrypt their data while storing it in the primary data store. Vault's security team manages and maintains the responsibility of the data encryption within the Vault environment, allowing developers to focus solely on encrypting/decrypting data as needed.

## Identity-Based Access

Organizations need a way to manage identity sprawl with the proliferation of different clouds, services, and systems- all with their identity providers. The risk of compromising an organization's security infrastructure increases as organizations are forced to manage multiple identity management systems as they try to implement solutions to unify a single logical identity across numerous cloud platforms. Different platforms support different methods and constructs for identity, making it difficult to recognize a user or identity across multiple forms of credentials. Vault solves this challenge by using a unified ACL system to broker access to systems and secrets and merges identities across providers. With [identity-based access](/docs/secrets/identity), organizations can leverage any trusted resource identity to regulate and manage system and application access and authentication across various clouds, systems, and endpoints.
