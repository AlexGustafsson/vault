# Azure secret management plugin

The Azure secrets engine dynamically generates Azure service principals along with role and group assignments. Vault roles can be mapped to one or more Azure roles, and optionally group assignments, providing a simple, flexible way to manage the permissions granted to generated service principals.

Each service principal is associated with a Vault lease. When the lease expires (either during normal revocation or through early revocation), the service principal is automatically deleted.

If an existing service principal is specified as part of the role configuration, a new password will be dynamically generated instead of a new service principal. The password will be deleted when the lease is revoked.
