# Azure authentication plugin

## Summary

Use the `azure` auth method to authenticate against Vault with Azure Active
Directory credentials.

It treats Azure as a Trusted Third Party and expects a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed by Azure Active Directory for the configured tenant.

This method supports authentication for system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities. See Managed identities for Azure resources for more information about these resources.

This documentation assumes the Azure method is mounted at the /auth/azure path in Vault. Since it is possible to enable auth methods at any location, please update your API calls accordingly.
