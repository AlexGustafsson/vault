# Automated entitlement utilization reporting

Automated entitlement utilization reporting sends minimal product-entitlement
metering data to HashiCorp without requiring you to manually collect and report
them. It also lets you review your entitlement usage with the monitoring
solution you already use (Splunk, Datadog, etc.) so you can optimize and manage
your deployments. 

Utilization reporting shares the minimum data required to validate entitlement
utilization as contractually obligated. They consist of mostly computed metrics
and will never contain PII or other sensitive information. Utilization reporting
shares the data with HashiCorp using a secure, unidirectional HTTPS API, and
makes an auditable record in the product logs each time it submits a report.

To enable automated reporting you need to upgrade to a version that supports it,
and open your network to outbound HTTPS traffic on port 443 from
`https://reporting.hashicorp.services`. If your installation is completely
air-gapped, you can’t use automated entitlement utilization and can opt out
instead. You do not need to re-sign the EULA to opt in or out. 

## Enable reporting

To enable automated entitlement utilization reporting, upgrade to a version that
supports it and make sure that your network allows the right egress traffic. 

### 1. Allow outbound traffic on port 443

Make sure that your network allows HTTPS egress on port 443 to
https://reporting.hashicorp.services. 

### 2. Upgrade

Upgrade to a release that supports entitlement utilization reporting. These
releases include:

- [Vault Enterprise 1.13.2](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/1.13.2+ent/) and later. 

### 3. Check logs

Automatic entitlement utilization reporting will start sending data within 24
hours. Check the product logs for records that the data sent successfully. 

Instructions on how to check logs. 

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```
TO DO: Add example log output
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

If your installation is air-gapped or your network doesn’t allow the correct
egress, logs will show an error. 

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```
TO DO: Add example error log
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Reconfigure your network to allow egress and check back in 24 hours. 

## Opt out

If your installation is air-gapped, or you want to manually collect and report
on the same entitlement utilization metrics, you can opt-out of automated
reporting. 

Manually reporting these metrics can be time consuming and does not prevent you
from sharing the minimum data required to validate entitlement utilization. If
you are considering opting out because you’re worried about the data, we
strongly recommend that you review the [example payloads]() before opting out.
If you have concerns with any of the automatically-reported data please bring
them to your account representative. 

You have two options to opt out of automated reporting: HCL configuration
(recommended) Environment variable (requires restart)

Opting out in your product’s configuration file doesn’t require a system
restart, and is the method we recommend. Add the following block to your
`configuration.hcl/json` file.

```hcl
reporting {
	license {
		enabled = false
   }
}
```

If you need to, you can also opt out using an environment variable, which will
provide a CLI message confirming that you have disabled automated reporting.
This option requires a system restart. Set the following environment variable on
the CLI.

```shell-session
$ export OPTOUT_LICENSE_REPORTING=true
```

Now, restart your system by following these instructions. 

Check your product logs 24 hours after opting out to make sure that the system
isn’t trying to send reports. 

## Example payloads

HashiCorp collects the following utilization data as JSON payloads:
`exporter_version` - The version of the licensing exporter

```json
TO DO: Add example
```
