# Vault Agent Exec

Vault Agent's Exec functionality allows Vault secrets to be injected into a
process via environment variables using [Consul Template markup][consul-templating-language].

Note: If you are running your applications in a Kubernetes cluster, we recommend evaluating the [Vault Secrets Operator](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso)
