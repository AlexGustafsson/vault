# Vault OS Support

HashiCorp provides and maintains a list of **Official Release Channels**. We highly recommended using officially supported HashiCorp releases in production environments since they are maintained by our internal teams and go through extensive security reviews.
Additionally, we also provide an **Official Packaging Guide** to help with installation of our packaging and distribution options.
