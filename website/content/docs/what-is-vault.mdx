## What is Vault?

HashiCorp Vault is an identity-based secrets and encryption management system. A _secret_ is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API encryption keys, passwords, and certificates. Vault provides encryption services that are gated by authentication and authorization methods. Using Vault’s UI, CLI, or HTTP API, access to secrets and other sensitive data can be securely stored and managed, tightly controlled (restricted), and auditable.

A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials,
API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture
communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very
difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and
detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is
where Vault steps in.

### How does Vault work?

![How Vault Works](/img/how-vault-works.png)

Vault validates and authorizes clients (users, machines, apps) before providing them access to secrets or stored sensitive data. The core Vault workflow consists of four stages:

![Vault Workflow](/img/vault-workflow-diagram1.png)

* **Authenticate:** A client uses their identity to authenticate with Vault.
* **Validation:** Vault validates the client against third-party trusted sources.
* **Authorize**: A client is matched against the Vault security policy.  This policy is a set of rules defining which API endpoints a client has access to with its Vault token.
* **Access**: Vault provides access to secrets, keys, and encryption capabilities based on policies associated with the client’s identity.

### Why Vault?

Most enterprises today have credentials sprawled across their organizations. Passwords, API keys, and credentials are stored in plain text, app source code, config files, and other locations. Because these credentials live everywhere, the sprawl can make it difficult and daunting to really know who has access and authorization to what. Having credentials in plain text also increases the potential for malicious attacks, both by internal and external attackers. 

Vault was designed with these challenges in mind. It takes all of these credentials and centralizes them so that they are defined in one location, which reduces unwanted exposure to credentials. But Vault takes it a few steps further by making sure users, apps, and systems are authenticated and explicitly authorized to access resources, while also providing an audit trail that captures and preserves a history of clients' actions.

The key features of Vault are:

- **Secure Secret Storage**: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored
  in Vault. Vault encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent
  storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access
  your secrets. Vault can write to disk, [Consul](https://www.consul.io),
  and more.

- **Dynamic Secrets**: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some
  systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application
  needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault
  will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After
  creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them
  after the lease is up.

- **Data Encryption**: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing
  it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and
  developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database
  without having to design their own encryption methods.

- **Leasing and Renewal**: All secrets in Vault have a _lease_ associated
  with them. At the end of the lease, Vault will automatically revoke that
  secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.

- **Revocation**: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault
  can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example
  all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type.
  Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the
  case of an intrusion.

### What is HCP Vault?

HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault is a hosted version of Vault, which is operated by HashiCorp to allow organizations to get up and running quickly. HCP Vault uses the same binary as self-hosted Vault, which means you will have a consistent user experience. You can use the same Vault clients to communicate with HCP Vault as you use to communicate with a self-hosted Vault.

-> **Tip:** Learn more about [HCP Vault](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/docs/vault) or [get started](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/cloud) by setting up a managed Vault cluster.

### Why HCP Vault?

Vault running on the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) enables users to secure, store, and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys within one unified cloud-based platform.

The benefits of HCP Vault are:

- **Reduce operational overhead:** Push-button deployment, fully managed
  upgrades, and backups mean organizations can focus on adoption and integration
  instead of operational overhead

- **Increase security across clouds and machines:** Secure your infrastructure
  across all your environments through a single interface and globally control
  and restrict access to sensitive data and systems

- **Control cost:** Reduce the number of systesm, licenses, and manual overhead
  by centralizing secrets management with HCP Vault

- **Day zero readiness:** Modern cloud security to quickly secure applications,
  access, and data from day zero.

- **Reliability:** HashiCorp has experience supporting thousands of commercial Vault
  clusters and HCP Vault brings that expertise directly to users.

- **Ease of use:** HCP Vault is built around making cloud security automation
  simple. Get up and running instantly so that you can onboard applications and teams easily.

~> **Note:** For the self-managed Vault Enterprise clusters, audit logging is a
manual configuration. Similarly, if your self-managed Vault is running Vault
with Integrated Storage, you can configure an automatic data snapshot; however,
it is a manual process to configure it yourself while it is automated for HCP
Vault.
