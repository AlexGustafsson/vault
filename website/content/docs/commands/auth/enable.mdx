# `auth enable`

Mount a new authentication plugin.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault auth enable [flags] <auth_plugin_type>

$ vault auth enable [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<Note>

  `vault auth *` commands let you enable, disable, move, and tune authentication
  plugins. To authenticate and log into to Vault as a user or machine, use the
  [`vault login`](/vault/docs/commands/login) command.

</Note>



## Description

`auth enable` enables an authentication plugin. Authentication plugins confirm
the identity of clients (users or machines) connecting to Vault and return a
token with the relevant access policy assigned. Clients use the returned token
to access sensitive information protected by Vault.

After enabling, most authentication plugins require configuration with
[`vault write`](/vault/docs/commands/write) and an appropriate 
[policy assignment](/vault/docs/concepts/policies) to work properly.

If a plugin already exists at the provided mount point, the command returns an
error.

## Arguments

PLUGIN_TYPE/NAME



## Options

None.



## Flags

- `-audit-non-hmac-request-keys` `(string: "")` - Key that will not be HMAC'd
  by audit devices in the request data object. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.
  An example of this is provided in the [tune section](/vault/docs/commands/auth/tune).

- `-audit-non-hmac-response-keys` `(string: "")` - Key that will not be HMAC'd
  by audit devices in the response data object. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-default-lease-ttl` `(duration: "")` - The default lease TTL for this auth
  method. If unspecified, this defaults to the Vault server's globally
  configured default lease TTL, or a previously configured value for the auth
  method. Uses [duration format strings](/vault/docs/concepts/duration-format).

- `-passthrough-request-headers` `(string: "")` - request header values that will
  be sent to the auth method. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-allowed-response-headers` `(string: "")` - response header values that the auth
  method will be allowed to set. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

@include 'cli/shared/flags/description.mdx'

- `-listing-visibility` `(string: "")` - The flag to toggle whether to show the
  mount in the UI-specific listing endpoint. Valid values are `"unauth"` or `"hidden"`,
  with the default `""` being equivalent to `"hidden"`.

- `-token-type` `(string: "")` - Specifies the type of tokens that should be
  returned by the auth method.

- `-trim-request-trailing-slashes` `(bool: false)` - If true, requests to
  this mount with trailing slashes will have those slashes trimmed.
  Necessary for some standards based APIs handled by Vault.

- `-plugin-version` `(string: "")` - Configures the semantic version of the plugin
  to use. If unspecified, implies the built-in or any matching unversioned plugin
  that may have been registered.
