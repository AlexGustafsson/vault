# plugin info

The `plugin info` displays information about a plugin in the catalog.
The plugin's type of "auth", "database", or "secret" must be included.

## deprecation_status field

As of 1.12, all builtin plugins will have an associated Deprecation
Status. This status will be reflected in the `deprecation_status` key/value
pair, seen below.

## Examples

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Output Options

- `-field` `(string: "")` - Print only the field with the given name. Specifying
  this option will take precedence over other formatting directives. The result
  will not have a trailing newline making it ideal for piping to other
  processes.

- `-clipboard` `(bool: false)` - When combined with `-field`, the output will be
  saved to the user's clipboard. For Linux users, this requires `xclip` or `xsel`
  to be installed.

- `-clipboard-ttl` `(duration: "", optional)` - When combined with `-clipboard`,
  the output will be saved to the user's clipboard until the specified TTL. After the
  TTL is up, the value is automatically removed from the clipboard.

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", or "yaml". This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable.

### Command Options

- `-plugin-version` `(string: "")` - Semantic version of the plugin to read from
  the catalog. If unspecified, refers to the unversioned plugin registered with
  the same name and type, or the built-in plugin, in that order of precedence.
