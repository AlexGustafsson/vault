# unwrap

The `unwrap` command unwraps a wrapped secret from Vault by the given token. The
result is the same as the "vault read" operation on the non-wrapped secret. If
no token is given, the data in the currently authenticated token is unwrapped.

## Examples

Unwrap the data in the cubbyhole secrets engine for a token:

```shell-session
$ vault unwrap 3de9ece1-b347-e143-29b0-dc2dc31caafd
```

Unwrap the data in the active token:

```shell-session
$ vault login 848f9ccf-7176-098c-5e2b-75a0689d41cd
$ vault unwrap # unwraps 848f9ccf...
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Output Options

- `-field` `(string: "")` - Print only the field with the given name. Specifying
  this option will take precedence over other formatting directives. The result
  will not have a trailing newline making it ideal for piping to other processes.

- `-clipboard` `(bool: false)` - When combined with `-field`, the output will be
  saved to the user's clipboard. For Linux users, this requires `xclip` or `xsel`
  to be installed.

- `-clipboard-ttl` `(duration: "", optional)` - When combined with `-clipboard`,
  the output will be saved to the user's clipboard until the specified TTL. After the
  TTL is up, the value is automatically removed from the clipboard.

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", or "yaml". This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable.
