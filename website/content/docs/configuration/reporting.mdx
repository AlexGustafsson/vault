  The reporting stanza configures per-cluster automated reporting of billing
  information. Vault Enterprise will automatically report the cluster's client
  counts using the license start date. Any modification of the default behavior
  should be specified in the reporting stanza.

# `reporting` stanza

The reporting stanza specifies configuration for [layout: docs
Automated entitlement utilization reporting](/vault/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting). 

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```hcl
reporting {
	license {
		...
	}
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Requirements

A valid Vault Enterprise license is required to enable automated reporting of
billing information.

## `reporting` parameters

The automated reporting feature exposes the following system settings:

- `enabled` `(bool)` - indicates whether automated reporting is enabled.
- `billing_start_timestamp` `(time)` - returns the configured billing start
  timestamp to be used for automated reporting.

**Example configuration:**

```hcl
reporting {
	license {
        enabled = true
        billing_start_timestamp = "2022-03-01T00:00:00Z"
	}
}
```

If an equivalent environment variable is set, the environment variable will take
precedence over values in the configuration file.

<Note>

Vault Enterprise uses client counts to calculate its billing information. To
provide the most accurate billing information, client count configuration
parameters require some restrictions while reporting is enabled. For more
information, refer to the [client counts API
doc](/vault/api-docs/system/internal-counters/#update-the-client-count-configuration).

</Note>

## Configuring a billing start timestamp

Vault Enterprise defaultS to reporting client counts periodically for the
current billing period. The current billing period must be specified via the
`reporting` stanza:

```hcl
reporting {
	license {
        billing_start_timestamp = "2022-03-01T00:00:00Z"
	}
}
```

If no `billing_start_timestamp` is specified, Vault Enterprise will default to
using the date associated with Vault's license.

<Note>

Vault Enterprise will not replicate reporting configuration changes to other
clusters. Any changes to the `reporting` stanza must be specified within each
cluster's HCL.

</Note>

## Disabling automated reporting

Reporting of billing information is enabled by default and you can disable it in
the `reporting` stanza. To disable automated reporting, set the `enabled`
parameter value to `false`:

```hcl
reporting {
	license {
        enabled = false
    }
}
```

Or, you can set an `OPTOUT_LICENSE_REPORTING` environment variable to
`true`.
