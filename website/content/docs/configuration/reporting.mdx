# `reporting` Stanza

Opting out in your Vault Enterprise configuration file doesnâ€™t require a system
restart. Add the following block to your `configuration.hcl` file.

```hcl
reporting {
	license {
		enabled = false
   }
}
```

Or, you can set an `OPTOUT_LICENSE_REPORTING` environment variable to
`true`.

<Note>

Refer to the [Automated entitlement utilization
reporting](/vault/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting) page for more
details.
