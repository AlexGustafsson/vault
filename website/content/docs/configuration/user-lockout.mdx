# User Lockout

@include 'user-lockout.mdx'

## `user_lockout` Stanza

The `user_lockout` stanza specifies various configurations for user lockout 
behaviour for failed logins in vault. They can be configured for all supported auth methods
(userpass, ldap and approle) using name "all" user_lockout stanza name or for a specific auth method 
using the auth method name in stanza. 

Supported user_lockout stanza names are all, userpass, ldap and approle.

The configurations for a specific auth method takes precedence over the configurations specified 
for all auth methods using "all" user_lockout stanza name in the config file.


## Configuration

the `user_lockout` stanza:

```hcl
user_lockout [NAME] {

}
```

```hcl
user_lockout "all" {
  lockout_duration = "10m"
  lockout_counter_reset = "5m"
}

user_lockout "userpass" {
  lockout_threshold = "25"
  lockout_duration = "5m"
}

user_lockout "ldap" {
 disable_lockout = "true"
}
```
