# Billing start date

It is the start of the period for which [client counts](/vault/docs/concepts/client-count/faq), [automated](/vault/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting) and [manual](/vault/docs/enterprise/license/manual-reporting) license utilization data will be reported for a cluster. This will be license start date if you do not have an explicit
billing start date configured. 

Vault also uses the billing start date as a default point of reference for:
- [Direct queries via the activitylog API](/vault/api-docs/system/internal-counters)
- [Activity export CLI](/vault/api-docs/system/internal-counters#activity-export)

As of 1.16.7, 1.17.3, 1.18+, Vault clusters will automatically adjust the billing start date to provide a year's worth of utilization data i.e; billing start dates from 
earlier years will get updated to current calendar year, unless the date has not yet occured this year, in which case
it will remain in the last calendar year. The billing start date will adjust accordingly for leap years.
