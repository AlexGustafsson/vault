# Managed Keys

~> Note: Managed Keys is an Enterprise only feature.

Within certain environments, customers want additional security guarantees of
Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) when handling, storing, and interacting with
private key material, or are required to do so by standards requirements.

To satisfy these requirements, Vault has a centralized configuration that
different secrets engines can plug into, allowing them to delegate these
operations to a trusted external party.

## Backend Support

Managed keys was developed to support different types of external backends.
At this time only a `PKCS#11` backend is supported, with the possibility of
future integrations being added.

## Plugin Support

The [PKI Secrets Engine](/api/secret/pki#managed-key) has been integrated
with Managed Keys to offer certificate generation, both root and intermediary
pki paths, leveraging private keys within an external trusted HSM.

## API

Managed keys can be managed over the HTTP API. Please see
[Managed Keys API](/api-docs/system/managed-keys) for more details.
